    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      After eight years as a general contractor business owner, I’ve cultivated a unique combination of hands-on expertise, leadership, and adaptability by managing complex, high-pressure projects from start to finish. My experience spans designing and executing full-scale renovations, coordinating teams and suppliers, and delivering exceptional results for clients. Now transitioning into the field of Electrical Engineering, I bring the same resilience, problem-solving skills, and results-driven approach to technological innovation. My journey reflects a commitment to growth and a passion for turning challenges into opportunities, whether on a construction site or in the lab.

        <h2>Relevant Coursework</h2>
        <h3>Logic Design | Lab Exam 5</h3>
		<p>- Achieved mastery in digital logic design, as measured by a 100% score on a lab exam requiring NAND‑based implementation of a combinational circuit and the synthesis of a sequential circuit, resulting in a full replication of the state diagram.</p>
		<p>- Developed advanced FPGA implementation skills, using Quartus to synthesize sequential circuits, assign pins, and upload functional designs to a DElite‑10 FPGA, precisely replicating state transitions as per the state diagram.</p>
		<h3>Electronic Devices and Circuits 1  | Projects</h3>
		<p>#3: Designed a single‑stage amplifier circuit using small signal analysis, tailoring the circuit to meet strict gain and AC input specifications while ensuring transistor stability and robust performance.</p>
		<p>#4: Implemented CMOS‑based logic gates by constructing transistor‑level designs that adhered to CMOS design principles, demonstrating expertise in digital logic and efficient circuit layout.</p>
